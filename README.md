## Netflix TV Shows Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)
This project was developed as part of a Model Deployment class group assignment. The goal is to build and implement a recommendation system for Netflix TV shows using content-based filtering.
By analyzing key content features such as genres, description, actors, and directors, the system recommends other TV shows that share similar attributes. Unlike collaborative filtering, this method does not require user ratings or external interaction data—only the content itself.

## Key Features
- Content-Based Filtering – analyzes Netflix show attributes (genres, description, cast, etc.) to recommend similar items.
- Personalized Recommendations – provides the Top 5 most relevant TV shows based on user input.
- Data Preprocessing & EDA – applied on Netflix dataset (sourced from Kaggle).
- Model Development with OOP – clean, modular, and reusable code.
- Pickle Integration – stores trained models and vectorizers for efficient deployment.
- Deployment – interactive web app built with Streamlit (frontend) and FastAPI (backend).

## Objective
To design, implement, and deploy a personalized Netflix recommendation system that enhances user experience and engagement by suggesting relevant TV shows. Users can interact with the system through a web application and instantly receive the Top 5 recommendations based on their chosen input.

## Project Details :
- **Dataset** : Netflix dataset from kaggle, sourcelink : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows
- **Recommendation Method** : Content-Based Filtering. This method focuses of the characteristic of the item and find the similarity between items and gave recommendation.
- **Deployment** : The model would be deploy using Streamlit, so users can interact with the system and get recommendation.
- **Output** : Streamlit application would output 5 recommended TV Shows from user inputs.
